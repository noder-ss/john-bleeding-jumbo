README CUDA:

Since (nearly) all systems supporting CUDA *also* support OpenCL, our CUDA
support has been dropped and you will get OpenCL formats instead.  The OpenCL
formats are much more mature than the pure CUDA alternatives and they are
also a strict superset of them (they largely outnumber the deprecated formats).
For more information, see doc/README-OPENCL.

If you, depsite that, want to look at or experiment with the deprecated CUDA
formats, the last git revision containing them was aa3602b.
